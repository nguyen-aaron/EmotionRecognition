# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Recognition Using Computer Vision

This project detects and classifies human emotions in real time using computer vision and deep learning. By analyzing facial expressions captured from a webcam or video feed, the system identifies emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **surprised**, **neutral**, and more.  

Built with **Python** and **YOLOv8**, this project demonstrates how modern deep learning models can be applied to emotion recognition tasks efficiently and accurately.
